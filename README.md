# TSDP2-Python-Project

This repo stores all the materials for the TSDP2 class I created during my time at the "Centre de Formacio Profissional d'Axiovall" in Andorra, from Januarry 9th to January 31st where I was a comptuer science teacher. 
The project show here is an attempt to recreate a project that I had worked on in the past to forecast renewable energy production but this in Spain.
